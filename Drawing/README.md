# Drawing
Simple, not very accurate, VB drawing App created for GitHub Training Purposes
Developed to practice maintaining code in GitHub repositories and sharing with fellow employees.
Written in VB a simple single Windows Form application that allows the end user to draw
lines in a PictureBox via 2 mous clicak (1st click start position of the line, 2nd click end position of
the line.  User can select Black, Red, green or Blue line colours and clear the drawing area.

Line position is calculated via MousePosition BUT this seems to be the mouse position in rleation
to the whole Windows desktop so probably needs adjusting by taking into account the position of
the forms VB PicrturBox control.
